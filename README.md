# Plagiarism-Detector
NLP
<br/>

This repository contains a Plagiarism Detection project that uses machine learning models to identify instances of plagiarism in textual data. The project includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and a simple web application for interacting with the trained model. <br/>
<br/>

**Project Overview** <br/>
Plagiarism detection is a crucial task in various fields such as academia, journalism, and content creation. This project implements a machine learning approach to detect plagiarism using several classification algorithms. After comparing the performance of multiple models, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model was selected due to its superior accuracy. <br/>
<br/>

**Models Used** <br/>
The following machine learning models were trained and evaluated: <br/>
* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest
* Naive Bayes
* Support Vector Machine (SVM) <br/>
Among these, the SVM model provided the best results and was chosen for the final implementation. <br/>
